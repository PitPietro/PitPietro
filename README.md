###¬†client-generator

As its [README](https://github.com/api-platform/client-generator/blob/main/README.md) says, **API Platform Client Generator** is a generator to scaffold app with **Create-Retrieve-Update-Delete** features for any **API** exposing a [Hydra](http://www.hydra-cg.com/spec/latest/core/) or [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) documentation for:

* Next.js
* Nuxt.js
* Quasar Framework
* React/Redux
* React Native
* TypeScript Interfaces
* Vue.js
* Vuetify.js

This list is missing an important frontend framework: [Angular](https://angular.io/).

As I need it in the company where I'm currently working, I'm contributing to `angular-material` version of [client-generator](https://github.com/luca-nardelli/client-generator/tree/angular-material) project developed by [api-platform](https://github.com/api-platform). This version is not yet being merged to the `main` branch of the repository since it's currently under development!
